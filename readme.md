# 100 days of css challenge | Day 2

Original site: [100 days of css](http://100dayscss.com/)
Had trouble reimplementing this design. The rotation after the translation of the equal elements is not in place. Also, had issue with z-index. The div.inner-container has a higher z-index than it's inner elements. User will need to click directly below equals sign for css transformation to start.
Will have to look at solution to figure out rest.
